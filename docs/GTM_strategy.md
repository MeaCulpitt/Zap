# Blink: Go-To-Market Strategy

The Blink GTM strategy focuses on aggressive geographic expansion and frictionless developer integration, utilizing Bittensor's emission schedule to subsidize the "Last Mile" of cloud gaming.

## 1. Initial Target Users & Use Cases

Blink prioritizes users and developers who suffer most from centralized infrastructure limitations.

### A. The "Global South" Competitive Gamer
* **Target:** High-fiber regions in Latin America, SE Asia, and Africa.
* **Value Prop:** Reduces ping from >100ms (to centralized hubs) to <15ms (to local Blink nodes).

### B. Indie "Instant Play" Pilot Partners
* **Target:** Developers looking to increase demo conversion rates.
* **Use Case:** "One-Click Demos" embedded in web store-pages, bypassing the need for multi-gigabyte downloads.

### C. The "Web3-Native" Cloud Console
* **Target:** Crypto-native gamers and DePIN enthusiasts.
* **Use Case:** A hardware-agnostic portal allowing low-end devices to stream high-fidelity Steam/Epic libraries via the Blink grid.

## 2. Distribution & Growth Channels

Blink scales through technical integration rather than high-cost advertising.

* **Blink SDK:** A "one-click" middleware for Unreal Engine 5 and Unity, allowing developers to offload rendering to the subnet natively.
* **Browser-Extension Strategy:** Chrome/Edge extensions that offer instant "Cloud Boosting" for web-based games and store pages.
* **Regional KOL Challenges:** High-profile "Ping Showdowns" with local streamers to prove the superiority of decentralized edge-nodes over centralized regional data centers.

## 3. Incentives for Early Participation

Blink uses $TAO$ emissions to solve the infrastructure bootstrapping problem.

### Miner Incentives: The "Scarcity Bounty"
* **Regional Multipliers:** 2.5x emission rewards for the first miners in "Zero-Node" urban centers.
* **Hardware Bounties:** Direct Alpha-token rewards for miners maintaining 99.9% uptime on RTX 4080+ hardware during the first 180 days.

### Validator Incentives: The "Integrity Dividend"
* **Discovery Rewards:** Validators earn increased dividends for successfully auditing and onboarding miners in underserved geographic territories.

### User Incentives: The "Proof of Play" Airdrop
* **Subsidized Streaming:** Free high-fidelity streaming for all users during the Phase 1 "Coverage" period.
* **Telemetry Rewards:** Users earn "Alpha" tokens for submitting encrypted lag-reports and performance data, helping refine the subnet's scoring algorithms.
