# Blink: Business Logic & Market Rationale

## 1. The Problem
Centralized cloud gaming suffers from "The Latency Floor." Because hardware is clustered in distant data centers, millions of users experience lag that makes competitive gaming impossible. Blink solves this by moving the hardware into the user's neighborhood.

## 2. Competitive Landscape
Blink competes by being "Closer, Faster, and Cheaper." 
* **vs. NVIDIA:** We eliminate the industrial-to-residential fiber hops.
* **vs. General GPU Clouds:** We provide a specialized "Gaming-First" validation layer that general compute subnets lack.

## 3. The Bittensor Advantage
Bittensor allows Blink to scale without Capital Expenditure (CapEx). By using $TAO$ emissions to incentivize miners, we create a self-organizing global grid that responds to market demand in real-time.

## 4. Sustainability Model
Blink's long-term value is driven by "Demand-Side" fees. By providing a cheaper, faster alternative to AWS/NVIDIA for game developers, we create a sustainable cycle where external revenue supports the tokenomics of the subnet.
