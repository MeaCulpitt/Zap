# Zap: The Decentralized Edge-Gaming Grid

**Zap** is a Bittensor subnet designed to commoditize high-performance, ultra-low latency compute. By leveraging a decentralized network of residential and edge-based GPUs, Zap eliminates the "physical latency floor" inherent in centralized cloud gaming, bringing "local-feel" performance to gamers globally.

## Overview

In the current cloud gaming landscape, players are tethered to distant industrial data centers. This centralization creates unavoidable lag and excludes billions of users in underserved regions. 

**Zap** flips this model. It incentivizes a global network of "miners" to host high-end gaming hardware (RTX 40-series and above) at the network's edge—physically closer to the end-user. Through **Yuma Consensus** and a novel **Input-to-Photon (I2P)** verification audit, Zap ensures that every millisecond of compute is real, responsive, and high-fidelity.
